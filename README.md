ShoppingGPT is an AI-powered intelligent shopping assistant that combines advanced natural language processing techniques to deliver a smart and seamless shopping experience. Built with a focus on performance, scalability, and user experience, ShoppingGPT integrates cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize e-commerce interactions.

## Features ‚ú®

- üß† **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Leverages the power of Google's Gemini model for natural, context-aware conversations.
- üìö **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Enhances responses with relevant product information from SQLite database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date product details.
- üõ£Ô∏è **Semantic Router**: Intelligently routes queries to the appropriate handling mechanism using advanced embedding techniques.
- üîç **Advanced Product Search**: Utilizes case-insensitive and partial matching capabilities, powered by efficient SQLite queries and indexing.
- üí¨ **Intelligent Chatbot Interface**: User-friendly chat interface designed for intuitive product queries and personalized recommendations.


## System Architecture

ShoppingGPT employs a modular, scalable architecture:

1. **User Interface (Flask Web App)**
   - Handles user input and displays responses

2. **Semantic Router**
   - Utilizes GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings
   - Classifies and routes user queries to appropriate handlers

3. **Query Handlers**
   a. **Chitchat Chain**
      - Manages general conversation
      - Leverages LLM (Gemini-1.5-flash) and ConversationBufferMemory
   
   b. **Shopping Agent**
      - Processes product-related queries
      - Employs various tools:
        - Product Search Tool (SQLite-based)
        - Policy Search Tool (FAISS-based)

4. **Data Storage**
   - SQLite database for product information
   - FAISS vector store for policy information

5. **External Services**
   - Google Generative AI API for LLM and embeddings

This architecture enables efficient query routing, context-aware responses, and seamless integration of product and policy information into the conversation flow.


### Key Components

- **Semantic Router**: Uses `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` to efficiently classify and route user queries.
- **RAG System**: Combines FAISS vector store for policy information and SQLite for product data, ensuring fast and relevant information retrieval.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` with the Gemini-1.5-flash model to generate human-like responses.
- **Product Search**: Implements a robust `ProductDataLoader` class for efficient SQLite query execution and result formatting.
- **Policy Search**: Uses FAISS for fast similarity search on company policies and guidelines.

## Data Structure üóÇÔ∏è

Product data is stored in SQLite and includes the following fields:

- `product_code`: Unique identifier (TEXT)
- `product_name`: Name of the product (TEXT)
- `material`: Material composition (TEXT)
- `size`: Available sizes (TEXT)
- `color`: Available colors (TEXT)
- `brand`: Manufacturer or seller (TEXT)
- `gender`: Target gender (TEXT)
- `stock_quantity`: Quantity in stock (INTEGER)
- `price`: Product price (REAL)
